# Image-captioning-VGG16

This repository contains the implementation of an image captioning system using a deep learning model that combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoder and a Transformer-based decoder.

# Overview
The project uses a CNN encoder (based on InceptionV3) to extract features from images, and a Transformer-based decoder to generate captions. The model is trained on a subset of the MS COCO dataset.
